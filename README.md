## Minesweeper  
##### Minesweeper is a computer game in which a single player can either win or lose by clicking squares on the board to reveal them. If the square clicked is safe, some other surrounding safe squares may also be revealed. If a revealed square is adjacent to a square with a bomb in it, it will show the number of bomb-holding squares it is adjacent to. The player can hold the control button on the keyboard while clicking to place a flag where they think there is a bomb. Once all flags (10) have been placed on all squares that have bombs in them, the player wins. If the player clicks on a bomb (without putting a flag on it) or the timer runs out, the player loses.
